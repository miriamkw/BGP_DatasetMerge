# TODO: Use GluPredKit commands to process all of the datasets

# Add a script where people just adjust where they stored their data folders,
# and then they run the script and all data will be processed by running glupredkit
# cli commands in the script (including setup_folders!).
# Comment out lines if they donâ€™t have the specific dataset.
# This script could even modify the folder names etc! So that its not called data/raw
